         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I haue thought it good (gentell Reader) to ſet before thyne eyes Thiſtorie of Theſeus &amp; Aryadne: the whiche, though the Style and Meetre be to baſe for ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte a Paterne of ſo many thynges: yet by the perſwaſions &amp; earneſt requeſt of diuers and thoſe my verye frendes, I haue gyuen it thee: wherin thou maiſte beholde, as in a Glaſſe almoſte all maner of dealynges for ſundry kindes of purpoſes. As if thou ſeeke for true loue, looke vpon Ariadne: who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tured her fame, body &amp; goods to go with Theſeus. If thou ſeeke for good counſell,
<pb facs="tcp:152035:4"/> howe to eſchewe the blaſynge brandes of the fyerye flames of loue, ſee Phedra. If Crafte, Diſſimulacion, Perfidye, Periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, or forgetfulnes of good turnes: behold Theſeus. If thou craue an Example of vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naturall luſt, lechery: or as I mought ſay, inceſt: let Phedra come before thyne eyes: who hauynge no reſpect to honeſtie, fame, ire of the Goddes, nor kynred: entyſed the vnconſtant Theſeus to forſake her Siſter, and loue her. Certaynly in that ſhe was a woman, ſhe deſerued pardon: but in that ſhee was a Siſter, ſhee deſerued perpetuall ignomynie and euerlaſtynge ſhame &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. And ſeynge the Siſter maye not truſte her Siſter, ſithe bothe came oute of one belye, and ſucked of one pappes: what other wyll be ſo mad, or ſo muche without reaſon as to truſt a woman? whoſe diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt partes haue hitherto, and yet do ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perlye playe their Pageantes, as no tonge can tell, no Pen can wryte, nor any harte comprehende: I wyll not that any honeſt and vertuous Woman be towched with that I mynde to ſaye: but they onely who in readynge hereof, ſhall by anye meanes fynde them ſelues agreeued. And I wyll touche no poynt, but onelye Beautie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152035:4"/>
            <p>For yf I ſhoulde ſaye, what I haue ſeene, reade and harde, a yeare were to lytell to tell of their trickes.</p>
            <p>Aſſuredly, he that deſyreth a fayre woman armeth him ſelfe to a right great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous aduenture: and why? a fayre wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is nothynge but a gaſynge ſtocke of ydell folkes: an earelye wakynge for them that bee lyghte: and ſhe that is deſired for her Beautie in her youthe, maye hope too haue but a ſorye lyfe in her age.</p>
            <p>An infallyble Rule it is, that ſhee that is deſyred for her fayreneſſe, is hated for her ſowleneſſe: and Beautie of trouthe is not perpetuall, but fadeth as the flowers and greene graſſe. Alſo he that hathe a fayre woman muſt ſuffre her pryde: for Beautie and Pryde go alwaye together. Alſo hee muſt ſuffre her expences: for beautie in the face, and folye in the head, be two wormes that fret the lyfe, and conſume the goodes. Alſo hee muſt ſuffre her Ryotes: for a faire woman wyll, that none but ſhee haue her commaundementes in the Howſe.</p>
            <p>Alſo bee muſte ſuffre her nyce Mynions: for a fayre woman wyll paſſe her time in pleaſures. Alſo hee muſte ſuffre her Preſumption: for euerye fyne and
<pb facs="tcp:152035:5"/> fayre woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyll haue preeminence before all other: &amp; at a worde, he that hath a fayre woman is apparelde with as great peryll as euer was Cartha with Scipio, Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem with Titus, or Rome with Brennus: No man complayneth that the Goddes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his deſtenies haue giuen him a foule wife: let euery man chuſe as him lyſt. The noble Armynus of Carthage for the ſpace of foureſcore yeres wherin he ruled the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth there, was as ſtraunge to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as famyliar to his Bookes. And this age paſſed, his frendes deſired him inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to take a wyfe, that the memorye of ſo perfyte a wyſe man might remayne to the poſterytie: and the more earneſt they were, the more he reſiſted &amp; ſayd: If ſhe be fowle, I ſhall abhorre her: if ſhe be fayre, I muſt take hede to her: if ſhe be ryche, I muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her: if ſhe be poore, I muſt mayntayne her: if ſhe be a ſhrew, I can not forbere her: and the leaſt plague of theſe is ſufficient to ſlaye a. M. men. But let vs ſee how they of olde tyme paſſed their dayes, &amp; let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whither the Grafts that were ſlipped from theſe trees, be any whyt degenerated from the olde ſtocke. Myrrha lay with her father. Byblys cauſed her brother Cannus
<pb facs="tcp:152035:5"/> for vniuſte and vnnaturall luſt to be bany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Medea ſlewe her Brother Abſyrtus, therby to ſcape her fathers danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; folow Iaſon into Grece: and this our Phedra left her ſiſter in a vaſt foreſt a pray to the fierce and cruel Beaſtes, and ran away with her Huſbande. I ſpeake not of any light fault, but of ſuche, wherby the fawties haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them no leſſe reproch in their time, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhame with vs by beynge Examples of ſo filthy factes. As for thoſe that lyue nowe with vs I feare me, thei ſhalbe as yll repor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted of tyme to come, as they be hated nowe with wiſe and auncient men: their lookes be ſo loftie, their gate ſo ſtately, their appa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rell ſo diſguiſed, their courage ſo hawtye, that you may muſe to here of their maners geſtures and behauiours, no leſſe then thei were Monſters, or thinges wherin Nature eyther had erred, or woulde not ſhewe her force. And where in time paſſed, all that was done otherwyſe then honeſtie permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted was done very ſecretely. Now (I know no cauſe why) they that be dyffamed do as muche reioyce in their naughtines, as they aforetime were aſhamed of their miſdedes: I can alledge no reaſon why ſuche thyngs ſhoulde come to paſſe nowe, rather then in
<pb facs="tcp:152035:6"/> tymes paſte: but that oure women lyue ſo yedellye, that they eſchewe all honeſte laboure, and whollye addicte them ſelues to vnhoneſt ydleneſſe. For this is certaine: where the handes is occupyed: there, the harte muſte needes do ſomwhat: and if I ſaye not true, let any man alleadge when euer there were moe ydell Women in the whole worlde, then is nowe in the ſmall Circuit of Englande. I reade, howe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers haue ben co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for kepynge them ſelues cloſe in their Howſes, vſynge them ſelues diſcretelye with companye: mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratelye with their Houſholde: decentlye with their Huſbandes. But neuer was any lauded, for leadynge of an ydell lyfe. You ydle Dames wherſoeuer you be, tell me I praye you? what was the cauſe that Penelope was ſo muche honoured in her tyme, and left eternal memorie of her good renowne to vs after her death? What trade of lyfe led ſhee when Vlyſſes was at the Siege of Troye? ſhee beynge a Quene dyd paynfullye ſpyn and keepe her howſe, and for all the knot of gentell Woers that ſhe had, ſhe neuer left her worke to dallye and toye with them, thoughe her Huſband were awaye .xx. yeares? What dyd the
<pb facs="tcp:152035:6"/> wicked Torquyne fynde the good Ladye Lucres doynge when he came to rauyſſhe her? If ye knowe not (O ye amorous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes to you I ſpeake) I wyll tell you: ſhee ſat ſpynnyge with her Maydes: and beyng deflowred: ſhee neither gaue Torquyne thankes for his good wyll, nor reward for his paynes, but flewe her ſelfe, becauſe her Huſbandes bedde was defyled. Let theſe to Ladyes be Examples, to you (O ye La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes enamorous) howe you ſhall occupye your ſelues in your Howſes: they were no vyle women, for the firſte was Quene of Ithaca, thother a Conſuls wyfe of Rome. But I ſuppoſe you cannot away with ſpin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge, for that vtterlye taketh awaye all vayne thoughtes, and occupyeth the minde with honeſt ſtudyes: for all the Senſes be moued by it: the eyes with ſeyeng that the threde be well twyned: the eares with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge the ſownde of the wheele: the hands with turnyng it aboute, ſo that no place is voyde of doing ſomwhat: wherby no yl can tary or raigne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart: thus much I haue ſaid becauſe Ariadnes idlenes cauſed al her griefe: for if ſhe had not be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> idle, ſhe had not gone out of her chamber: if ſhe had not gon out of her chamber, ſhe had not come to the
<pb facs="tcp:152035:7"/> Laberynthe wherein Theſeus was: if ſhee had not gone to the Laberynthe, ſhe hadde not hard his complaint: if ſhe had not hard his complaint, ſhe had not loued him: if ſhe had not loued him, ſhe had ben ſafe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chaunce whiche happened to her: as in the Hiſtorye ſhalbe declared. Ydlenes is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ground of all vice, &amp; ouerthroweth quyte all the foundations of Vertue. But as I haue ſaid of theſe two, I might ſpeake of many mo: but this is ynough if it be wel vnderſtanded. But to leaue this, and come to the Hiſtorye agayne, from the whiche I haue a lytle dygreſſed: if thou looke for an example of paynfulnes, take them all, and thynke with howe great paines they ſlewe and ſubdued the fel Monſter Mynotaurus: If thou deſire to here of vnmercyfulnes of Parentes, caſt thou eyes to Theſeus, who loſt his father Egeus through his defaut. But becauſe it is but lytle touched in this Hiſtorye, I wyll pretermyt that: Yf myſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, call to mynde Aryadne left in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe: and to be ſhort of all vnhappynes let her be a Paterne. I might apply eche of theſe to diuers other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men places: but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhould make my Entry greater then my whole Howſe. I wyll therfore leue the reſt
<pb facs="tcp:152035:7"/> to be ſcanned of thee (gentle Reader) &amp; if I ſhal perceiue that this is welcome to thee, hereafter as occaſion ſhall ſerue, thou ſhalt encourage me to do the more: Thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge that thou wilte take in good parte whatſoeuer is ſaid herein, I byd thee fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well: deſirynge thee if oughte bee amyſſe, frendlye to correcte it, or gentlye to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſſhe mee therof.

            <l>THere dwelt ſomtyme in Crete a kyng;</l>
            <l>that mightie Minos hight:</l>
            <l>Who had to wife Paſiphae,</l>
            <l>a paſſyng wylye wight.</l>
            <l>This carefull Quene bewayled ſore,</l>
            <l>her huſbandes abſence longe:</l>
            <l>She did lament with penſiue thought.</l>
            <l>her iniurie and wronge.</l>
            <l>And moſte for that dame Venus ſport</l>
            <l>ſhe wanted ſuche a ſpace:</l>
            <l>There was no man in all her Court,</l>
            <l>that could deſerue her grace.</l>
            <l>They were eche one to baſe of bloud,</l>
            <l>or of to lowe degree:</l>
            <l>As that they might obtayne or haue</l>
            <l>ſo peereleſſe a Ladie.</l>
            <l>And why? ſhe did mutche more eſteeme</l>
            <l>her honour and her fame:</l>
            <l>Then that ſhe liſt to haſard them,</l>
            <l>with ſutche reproche and ſhame.</l>
            <l>Thus did therfore her broylyng breaſt,</l>
            <l>inuent to put in vre:</l>
            <l>Leaſt that her ardent ſecrete flames,</l>
            <l>ſhuld not be kept in ſure.</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:152035:9"/>
            <l>A Cowe of wodde for to be made,</l>
            <l>ſhee did therfore deuiſe:</l>
            <l>Compacte with connyng handycrafte,</l>
            <l>and perfite Artifice.</l>
            <l>For Dedalus the Carpenter,</l>
            <l>did frame it in ſutche ſorte:</l>
            <l>As it once ſeene, you would in dede,</l>
            <l>a very Cowe reporte.</l>
            <l>For it one were within the wood,</l>
            <l>the gynnes were trimmed ſo,</l>
            <l>That if they were pluckt aright,</l>
            <l>the Cowe would walke or go.</l>
            <l>This worke when it was finiſſhed,</l>
            <l>the quene for her ſolace,</l>
            <l>would oftimes get into the ſame,</l>
            <l>and ſitte in it a ſpace.</l>
            <l>Tyl that the Gynnes ſhe could once turne</l>
            <l>and rule them as ſhe lyſt:</l>
            <l>Then ſhe to worke her wanton wyll,</l>
            <l>begyns as ſhe thynkes beſt.</l>
            <l>Somtymes ſhe goes, ſomtimes ſhe ronnes</l>
            <l>ſomtymes ſhe lyeth ſtyll:</l>
            <l>And finally ſhe doth eche thynge,</l>
            <l>that pleaſes her wicked wyll.</l>
            <l>Then ſmellynge oyntments doth ſhe take</l>
            <l>and doth annoynt this Cowe:</l>
            <l>For to prouoke the boyſterous Bull,</l>
            <l>as women knowe well howe.</l>

            <l>the Bull alſo is brought:</l>
            <l>And there betwixt the Bull and Cowe</l>
            <l>is pretie paſtime wrought.</l>
            <l>Paſiphae thus hath her wyll,</l>
            <l>except I be beguylde:</l>
            <l>Soone after this congreſſe was done,</l>
            <l>the Quene was founde with childe,</l>
            <l>Shortlye after, the kynge retournde</l>
            <l>and did lye by this quene,</l>

            <l>For when ſhe ſhould be brought to bed,</l>
